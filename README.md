# React Test For Keywordio's Machine Test - part 1

## Overview 
This repository represents part one of the task submitted for a machine test. 

## Technologies Used 
1. ReactJS
2. Sass (for styling)
3. ChartJS (for chart)
4. MaterialUI (for icons)

## Features 
1. A top navigation which includes Dashboard & Create Ad navigation options
2. Tables include sorting functionality (High to Low & Low to High)
3. A toggle for Ads Insights to toggle between a doughnut chart & table
4. A dropdown for metrics in Ads Insights. Selecting a matric will show data in the doughnut chart for that metric.
5. Based on the checkboxes (Text Ad and/or Media Ad), redirects to the Fill Data page and shows respective inputs.
6. After submitting the form, redirects to Ads Submitted page, waits for 0.6 seconds, and redirects to Create Ads Page
7. The website is also made resposive for cross device compatibility.

## My Approach
At the outset, I encountered the challenge of sorting tables and creating charts, which were relatively new to me. To address this, I initially focused on enhancing the navigation menu's functionality after which I jumped back to the tables and charts wherein I met with some initial struggles. I decided to temporarily set them aside and shift my attention to the other project pages, which involved more familiar concepts.

Once I successfully implemented the functionality on these pages, I revisited the initial table and chart tasks. I utilized this opportunity to conduct proper research on tables in React and sorting techniques, along with delving into the intricacies of chart.js. This approach allowed me to overcome the initial hurdles and eventually produce the desired results.
